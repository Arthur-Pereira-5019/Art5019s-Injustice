# Art5019's Injustice

Art5019's Injustice is a mod to add super experiences to your game, which allows you to live the experience of different superheroes and villains mythologies.

## About

For more about the mod gameplay or ingame features, check the Trello wiki. Currently, we're moving to Notion.

Why I use MCreator: The mod runs on the Forge API as most of the other mods, which is based on Java, JSON and Gradle. This mod specificaly is made with a low-code plataform called MCreator. Obviously, a low-code generated software doesn't have the tenth of the power actual programming have, BUT despite being stored in Github, this repository isn't for faking programming skills in order to try to get some reward in the future. It's just for practicing git version management, creating backups and making the mod open source. The mod itself is a personal hobby, not a part-time job, and it is created for people to have fun with extense content, which a lot of other mods of the genre doesn't achieve (Most stop at superpower, suits and weapons, mine have bosses, biomes, mobs, mechanics, events). 

Afterall: 1) Mods aren't profitable. 2) Mods consume a lot of time to make (specially if you don't have a decent team of atleast 3 underpaid college students). 3) The API which is used to create them (Forge) won't teach me anything else than itself since it's made only for modmaking and nothing more than that, so there are other more efficient ways to learn Java and actual programming logic (which I'm currently doing). 

About the "You could still become a better programmer on logic by doing manual coding", well my answer to that is: Having actual content to work with makes you actually worry about optimization, so despite not writing the code, my mind is forced to think in the most optimal ways to create stuff and update them without losing hours doing ant colony work.

Still, sometimes when I feel it's worth of my time (Forge isn't famous from being an amazing and efficient API to work with), I lock the generated code and try to venture myself in the world of Forge code.

TLDR: Learning propper Forge would slow down my mod production, which is a hobby I do for mine and other people's fun, and wouldn't make me a better programmer at all.
